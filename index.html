        common element types that divide/describe a page are meta-related elements, content divison elements, and semantic elements.

          <h2>css</h2>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          </li> in CSS we broadly have two types of boxes — block boxes and inline boxes. The type refers to how the box behaves
          in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page. Boxes have an inner display type and an outer display
          type
          <li>The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes and defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border,
            padding, and content — work together to create a box that you can see on a page.
            Inline boxes use just some of the behavior defined in the box model.Content box: The area where your content is
            displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.</li>
          <li>Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.</li>
          <li>Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.</li>
          <li>Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this
            box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.</li>
